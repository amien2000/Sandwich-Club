# Sandwich Club App

This is my first project for Nano Degree program at Udacity.

## Project Overview
**Sandwich Club** app shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

Core Functionality: 

1) JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils

2) JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries

3) DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly

4) Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices

5) Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label.
